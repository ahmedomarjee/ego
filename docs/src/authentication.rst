Authentication
==============

Authentication concerns who the user *is*. 

Using the Oauth 2.0 protocol, users can sign into Ego using their 
Google/Facebook account. 

Ego will then issue an authentication token, which confirms the user's identity, and contains information about the user's name, their role (user or adinistrator), and any applications, permissions, and groups associated with their Ego account.
