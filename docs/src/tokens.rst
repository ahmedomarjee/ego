Tokens
======
There are three distinct types of "tokens" used in Ego.

1) User Authentication tokens, which are used to verify a user's identity. 

2) User Authorization tokens, which a user can use selectively authorize all or some of their Ego-authorized applications to perform activities based upon a named set of permissions.  

3) Application Authentication tokens, which applications use when they 
communicate with Ego.

You can find out more of each type of token by following the links below.
